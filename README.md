# WeatherWebApp
Technologically, the Weather Web App is built with Angular for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. It seamlessly integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to provide accurate and current weather information. To set up the app locally, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and ensure npm Node.js is installed and angularcli.
